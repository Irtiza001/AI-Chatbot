# AI-Chatbot
This project is an AI-based chatbot application developed in Java using Android Studio as part of my Mobile Application Development (MAD) course. The app features a clean and responsive Android UI, enabling real-time text-based conversations. It uses basic keyword matching and logic-based responses to simulate intelligent interactions.
